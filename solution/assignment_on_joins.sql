/*NOTE : In general, JOIN operations are more efficient than subqueries. This is because subqueries are executed for each row in the outer query, 
while JOIN operations create a temporary table that can be used multiple times. 
However, the actual efficiency of a query depends on many factors such as
 the size of the tables, the presence of indexes, the complexity of the WHERE clause, and the specific database engine being used.
 
In the case of the two queries you provided, it's possible that the JOIN query may be more efficient than the subquery version,
 especially if there are indexes on the relevant columns.

/*QUEST TIME : BOTH THE CODE GIVES THE SAME RESULT . HOWEVER TELL ME WHICH QUERY IS MORE EFFICIENT ???? TAKE 2 MINUTES TO THINK BEFORE ANSWERING*/

/*ANSWER ::: 
In terms of performance, the first query is generally more efficient because it uses the "AND" operator to filter results based on both the department location and department number,
 which can lead to fewer rows being joined together.
 
 In contrast, the second query uses the "WHERE" clause to filter results based only on the department location after the join, 
 which can result in more rows being joined and potentially slower performance.
